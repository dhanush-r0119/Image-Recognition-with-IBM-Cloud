1. Uploading Images
Click on the "Upload Image" button on the home page to start the image recognition process.
Choose an image from your device by either clicking the upload area or using the drag-and-drop feature.
Wait for the system to process the image and generate a descriptive caption.
2. Viewing AI-Generated Captions
Once the image is processed, you will see the AI-generated caption displayed on the screen. The caption describes the objects or scenes recognized in the image, enhancing your understanding of its content.

3. Error Handling
If you encounter any issues during the image recognition process, our system is designed to provide clear error messages. Here are a few common scenarios and how to handle them:

Invalid Image: If the uploaded file is not a supported image format or exceeds the maximum file size, you will receive an error message. Please make sure to use images in formats like JPEG or PNG and ensure the file size is within the specified limits.

API Error: In rare cases, there may be issues with our image recognition service. If you receive an API error, please try again later. If the issue persists, contact our support team.
